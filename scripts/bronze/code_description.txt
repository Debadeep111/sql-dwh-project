# 🚀 Bronze Layer Data Loading Procedure

## 🔹 Overview
The `bronze.load_bronze` stored procedure automates the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process** for loading data into the **Bronze Layer** of a Data Warehouse. It processes datasets from both **CRM** and **ERP** sources.

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **⏳ Start Tracking Execution Time**
   - Logs timestamps to measure processing duration.

2. **📥 Loading Data from CRM**
   - `bronze.crm_cust_info` ⏩ `cust_info.csv`
   - `bronze.crm_prd_info` ⏩ `prd_info.csv`
   - `bronze.crm_sales_details` ⏩ `sales_details.csv`

3. **📥 Loading Data from ERP**
   - `bronze.erp_cust_az12` ⏩ `cust_az12.csv` (Loaded twice—potential redundancy!)
   - `bronze.erp_loc_a101` ⏩ `loc_a101.csv`

4. **⏳ Logging Time Taken for Each Table**
   - Uses `DATEDIFF(second, @start_time, @end_time)`

5. **✅ Completion**
   - Logs total execution time for the Bronze Layer.

## 🛑 Potential Improvements
🔸 **Duplicate Loading of `bronze.erp_cust_az12`** – Ensure this isn't redundant.  
🔸 **Error Handling** – Add `TRY...CATCH` blocks for failure recovery.  
🔸 **Dynamic File Paths** – Use configurable parameters instead of hardcoded file paths.

💾 **To Execute the Procedure:**
